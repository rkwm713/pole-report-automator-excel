# Make-Ready Report Excel Output Fixes

This document explains the changes made to fix issues in the Make-Ready Report Excel output, specifically with columns J, K, and O, as well as the proper positioning of the From/To Pole rows.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Height Values in Columns J & K

**Issue:** The output was showing "N/A" for the height values in columns J and K (Height Lowest Com and Height Lowest CPS Electrical) instead of actual height values.

**Fix:** Improved the `_extractExistingMidspanData` method to properly extract and process the height data from Katapult. The function now correctly identifies the lowest height for communication and electrical wires across all spans connected to a pole.

### 2. From Pole/To Pole Placement

**Issue:** The From Pole/To Pole information was appearing in the wrong position (around rows 23-24), but should be in the last two rows of each pole section.

**Fix:** 
- Updated `_calculateEndRow` to account for From/To Pole rows (adding 2 rows)
- Modified `_writePoleData` to place From/To Pole rows at the correct position
- Enhanced `_writeAttachmentData` to ensure proper alignment with the From/To Pole rows

### 3. Mid-Span Proposed Values (Column O)

**Issue:** Column O was showing "N/A" instead of correct values like "21'-1"".

**Fix:** Enhanced the `_getMidSpanProposedHeight` method to better match wires between SPIDAcalc and Katapult data using a scoring system that considers:
1. Owner matches (primary criteria)
2. Type matches (secondary criteria)
3. Height similarity (tertiary criteria)

## Code Changes

The main changes were made to the following methods in `PoleDataProcessor.ts`:

1. `_calculateEndRow` - Now adds 2 rows for From/To Pole
2. `_writePoleData` - Places From/To Pole in the last two rows of each pole section
3. `_writeAttachmentData` - Ensures proper row alignment
4. `_extractExistingMidspanData` - Fixed to correctly extract lowest midspan heights
5. `_getMidSpanProposedHeight` - Enhanced wire matching to correctly identify midspan heights

## Testing the Changes

### Automated Test

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
ts-node src/test-fixed-excel-output.ts
```

The test will:
1. Try to load test data files if available
2. Fall back to generated demo data if test files aren't found
3. Process the data and generate a fixed Excel report
4. Save the output to `fixed-make-ready-report.xlsx`

### Test Script Features

- Automatically finds test data in common locations
- Can run with either real data or demo data
- Reports validation issues
- Shows a summary of fixed issues

### Expected Output Structure

The Excel report should now have:

1. Proper height values in columns J & K (top row of each pole section)
2. From/To Pole rows at the bottom of each pole section
3. Correct midspan values in column O
4. Blank rows added as needed to maintain proper structure

Example:
```
Row 4: [1] [(I)nstalling] [CPS] [PL410620] [...] [14'-10"] [23'-10"] [Neutral] [29'-6"] [] [21'-1"]
Row 5: [] [] [] [] [...] [] [] [CPS Supply Fiber] [28'-0"] [24'-7"] [21'-1"]
Row 6: [] [] [] [] [...] [] [] [Charter Spectrum Fiber Optic] [23'-7"] [24'-7"] [21'-1"]
...
Row 10: [] [] [] [] [...] [From Pole] [To Pole] [] [] [] []
Row 11: [] [] [] [] [...] [PL410620] [PL398491] [] [] [] []
